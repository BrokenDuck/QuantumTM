  title       = {A formal proof of the four color theorem},
  abstract    = {A formal proof has not been found for the four color theorem since 1852 when Francis Guthrie first conjectured the four color theorem. Why? A bad idea, we think, directed people to a rough road. Using a similar method to that for the formal proof of the five color theorem, a formal proof is proposed in this paper of the four color theorem, namely, every planar graph is four-colorable. The formal proof proposed can also be regarded as an algorithm to color a planar graph using four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.},

  title       = {A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search},
  abstract    = {Imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in completely random order. In order to find someone's phone number with a 50% probability, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to look at a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We provide a tight analysis of Grover's recent algorithm for quantum database searching. We give a simple closed-form formula for the probability of success after any given number of iterations of the algorithm. This allows us to determine the number of iterations necessary to achieve almost certainty of finding the answer. Furthermore, we analyse the behaviour of the algorithm when the element to be found appears more than once in the table and we provide a new algorithm to find such an element even when the number of solutions is not known ahead of time. Using techniques from Shor's quantum factoring algorithm in addition to Grover's approach, we introduce a new technique for approximate quantum counting, which allows to estimate the number of solutions. Finally we provide a lower bound on the efficiency of any possible quantum database searching algorithm and we show that Grover's algorithm nearly comes within a factor 2 of being optimal in terms of the number of probes required in the table.},
